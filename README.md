# cxf-client-skeleton

Simple project to show how to generate java/cxf client code using the codegen plugin.  

ALWAYS try and have the WSDL/Schemas inside the project committed to source control, and increment the version numbers on the pom for new releases.  

This way you are able to track the changes in the WSDL, and release updates accordingly.
